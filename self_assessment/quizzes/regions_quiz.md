      "answers": [
        {"answer": "A semantic area in the kinematic tree (e.g., table surface)", "correct": True},
        {"answer": "A physical body used for collision only", "correct": False},

      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "answers": [
        {"answer": "Like bodies, via connections (e.g., FixedConnection)", "correct": True},
        {"answer": "It floats without connections", "correct": False},
        {"answer": "It is attached via textures", "correct": False},
        {"answer": "It uses special region-only connectors", "correct": False}
      ],

        {"answer": "with world.transaction():", "correct": False},

      "question": "If the supporting table moves, what happens to the attached Region?",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "answers": [
        {"answer": "It moves accordingly because it is connected", "correct": True},
        {"answer": "It remains fixed at the world origin", "correct": False},
        {"answer": "It randomly jitters", "correct": False},
        {"answer": "It scales with the table's bounding box", "correct": False}

      "explanation": "The Region follows its connection to the table top."
